# Claude CLI Integration

## Why integrate Claude CLI with OpenClaw?

If you're using both Claude CLI (claude code) and OpenClaw, they share the same Anthropic API quota. Knowing your usage across both tools helps you:

- Avoid hitting rate limits unexpectedly
- Plan heavy work sessions around remaining quota
- Monitor the 4-hour rolling window and weekly limits

The challenge: Claude CLI is interactive. It needs a terminal (TTY) to run commands like `/usage`.

The solution: Use `tmux` to automate the interaction and capture output.

---

## How it works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  You ask OpenClaw: "check my Claude usage"          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OpenClaw runs a script that:                       │
│  1. Starts Claude CLI in a tmux session             │
│  2. Accepts workspace trust                         │
│  3. Sends /usage command                            │
│  4. Captures the output                             │
│  5. Kills the session and returns stats             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OpenClaw sends you the formatted usage stats       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Claude CLI installed:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **tmux installed:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install tmux
   ```

3. **Claude CLI authenticated** (first run completes OAuth flow)

---

## The script

Create `~/.openclaw/scripts/claude-usage`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Get Claude CLI usage stats via tmux automation

# Kill any existing session
tmux kill-session -t claude_usage 2>/dev/null

# Start claude in tmux (detached)
tmux new-session -d -s claude_usage -c "$HOME/.openclaw/workspace" "$HOME/.local/bin/claude"
sleep 2

# Accept workspace trust prompt
tmux send-keys -t claude_usage Enter
sleep 2

# Send /usage command
tmux send-keys -t claude_usage "/usage" Enter
sleep 2

# Select Usage tab
tmux send-keys -t claude_usage Enter
sleep 2

# Capture output
OUTPUT=$(tmux capture-pane -t claude_usage -p | grep -A 20 "Current session" | head -20)

# Cleanup
tmux kill-session -t claude_usage 2>/dev/null

# Display
echo "📊 CLAUDE USAGE STATS"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "$OUTPUT"
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/scripts/claude-usage
```

---

## How the automation works

### Step 1: Create a detached tmux session

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s claude_usage -c /path/to/workspace "claude"
```

- `-d` = detached (runs in background)
- `-s claude_usage` = session name
- `-c /path` = working directory
- Last argument = command to run

### Step 2: Send keystrokes

```bash
tmux send-keys -t claude_usage Enter
```

This simulates pressing Enter to accept the workspace trust prompt.

### Step 3: Capture terminal output

```bash
tmux capture-pane -t claude_usage -p
```

- `capture-pane` = grabs visible terminal content
- `-p` = print to stdout (instead of to a buffer)

### Step 4: Clean up

```bash
tmux kill-session -t claude_usage
```

Always clean up to avoid orphaned sessions.

## Usage stats explained

The `/usage` command in Claude CLI shows:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Current session** | 4-hour rolling window (resets continuously) |
| **Current week (all models)** | Weekly quota across Opus, Sonnet, Haiku |
| **Current week (Sonnet only)** | Separate Sonnet-specific quota |
| **Extra usage** | Optional paid overflow (if enabled) |

Example output:
```
Current session
████████████▌                                      25% used
Resets 3am (UTC)

Current week (all models)
███████                                            14% used
Resets Feb 15, 7pm (UTC)

Current week (Sonnet only)
██▌                                                5% used
Resets Feb 16, 4am (UTC)
```

---

## Integrating with your CLI

If you have a personal CLI (like `turtleand`), add a command:

```bash
claude-usage|cu)
    echo "Fetching Claude CLI usage stats..."
    "$SCRIPTS_DIR/claude-usage"
    ;;
```

Now you can run:
```bash
turtleand claude-usage
# or
turtleand cu
```

---

## Asking OpenClaw to check usage

Once the script exists, just tell your agent:

> "Check my Claude usage"

OpenClaw will run the script and return the stats.

You can also set up a cron job to get usage reports at specific times:

```json
{
  "name": "claude-usage-morning",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 9 * * *",
    "tz": "America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires"
  },
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "Run ~/.openclaw/scripts/claude-usage and send me the results."
  },
  "sessionTarget": "main"
}
```

---

## Key learnings

1. **Interactive CLIs need TTY** — Use tmux to provide a pseudo-terminal
2. **Timing matters** — Add `sleep` between commands for the UI to render
3. **Capture strategically** — Use `grep` to extract relevant sections
4. **Clean up always** — Kill tmux sessions to avoid resource leaks

---

## Next steps

- Set up usage alerts when approaching quota limits
- Create a dashboard combining OpenClaw + Claude CLI usage
- Automate model switching based on remaining quota

# Cron Jobs & Scheduled Automation

## What are cron jobs in OpenClaw?

OpenClaw includes a built-in cron scheduler that lets your agent run tasks automatically — without you sending a message.

Use cases:
- **Morning briefings** — Agent compiles overnight insights and delivers them when you wake up
- **Accountability nudges** — Reminders that escalate if you don't complete a goal
- **Daily backups** — Automatic state sync to cloud storage
- **Work check-ins** — Structured prompts at key moments in your day
- **Security audits** — Daily reports on system health

Think of it as:

> "Your agent doing things on a schedule, not just when you ask."

---

## How cron jobs work

Cron jobs in OpenClaw are managed internally by the Gateway — not as files on disk.

**Key concepts:**
- Jobs are created/modified via tool calls (`cron action=add/update/remove`)
- Each job has a schedule (cron expression or one-time timestamp)
- Jobs can target the main session or spawn isolated sessions
- Jobs can deliver messages directly to Telegram/Discord/etc.

---

## Schedule types

### Recurring (cron expression)

```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 9 * * 1-5",
    "tz": "America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires"
  }
}
```

This runs at 09:00 Monday-Friday in the specified timezone.

**Cron expression format:** `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`

Common patterns:
- `0 9 * * *` — Daily at 09:00
- `0 9 * * 1-5` — Weekdays at 09:00
- `0 */2 * * *` — Every 2 hours
- `30 18 * * 5` — Fridays at 18:30

### One-time (at timestamp)

```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "at",
    "at": "2026-02-09T22:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Runs once at the specified ISO 8601 timestamp. Useful for reminders. One-shot jobs auto-delete after success by default.

---

## Payload types

### systemEvent (main session)

Injects a message into the main session as if it were a system event:

```json
{
  "sessionTarget": "main",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "REMINDER: Check your GitHub commits for today."
  }
}
```

The agent wakes up, sees the message, and responds in context.

### agentTurn (isolated session)

Spawns a fresh session with its own context:

```json
{
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run the morning briefing compilation task.",
    "model": "sonnet",
    "deliver": true,
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "123456789"
  }
}
```

Good for:
- Long-running tasks that shouldn't clutter main session
- Different model/thinking settings
- Direct delivery to a channel

---

## Real examples

### Morning briefing delivery

```json
{
  "name": "Morning Briefing Delivery",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 11 * * *",
    "tz": "UTC"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "wakeMode": "next-heartbeat",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Read the latest overnight briefing file and deliver it to Turtleand.",
    "model": "sonnet"
  },
  "delivery": {
    "mode": "announce",
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "5586308961"
  }
}
```

### Accountability check with escalation

```json
{
  "name": "content-goal-daily-check",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 9 * * 1-5",
    "tz": "America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "main",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "CONTENT GOAL CHECK: Read memory/CONTENT-STATS.md. If weekly goals not met, calculate days behind and send reminders. Formula: 2^(daysBehind-1) notifications spread throughout the day."
  }
}
```

### One-time reminder

```json
{
  "name": "x-followup-reminder",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "at",
    "at": "2026-02-09T22:00:00Z"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "main",
  "wakeMode": "now",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "REMINDER: Follow up on your X post with the blog link."
  },
  "deleteAfterRun": true
}
```

### Daily backup

```json
{
  "name": "daily-backup",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 23 * * *",
    "tz": "UTC"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "wakeMode": "next-heartbeat",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run ~/.openclaw/scripts/backup-state auto and report results."
  },
  "delivery": {
    "mode": "announce",
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "5586308961"
  }
}
```

---

## Managing cron jobs (CLI)

### List all jobs

```bash
openclaw cron list
```

### Add a one-shot reminder (main session)

```bash
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Reminder" \
  --at "2026-02-01T16:00:00Z" \
  --session main \
  --system-event "Reminder: check your goals for the week." \
  --wake now \
  --delete-after-run
```

### Add a recurring job (isolated session with delivery)

```bash
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Morning brief" \
  --cron "0 7 * * *" \
  --tz "America/Los_Angeles" \
  --session isolated \
  --message "Summarize overnight updates." \
  --announce \
  --channel telegram \
  --to "5586308961"
```

### Run a job manually

```bash
openclaw cron run <job-id>
```

### View run history

```bash
openclaw cron runs --id <job-id>
```

### Remove a job

```bash
openclaw cron remove <job-id>
```

## JSON schema (for tool calls)

If calling the cron tool directly from an agent:

### One-shot main session job

```json
{
  "name": "Reminder",
  "schedule": { "kind": "at", "at": "2026-02-01T16:00:00Z" },
  "sessionTarget": "main",
  "wakeMode": "now",
  "payload": { "kind": "systemEvent", "text": "Reminder text" },
  "deleteAfterRun": true
}
```

### Recurring isolated job with delivery

```json
{
  "name": "Morning brief",
  "schedule": { "kind": "cron", "expr": "0 7 * * *", "tz": "America/Los_Angeles" },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "wakeMode": "next-heartbeat",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Summarize overnight updates."
  },
  "delivery": {
    "mode": "announce",
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "5586308961"
  }
}
```

---

## Escalating accountability pattern

A powerful pattern: reminders that increase in frequency the longer you avoid a goal.

**Logic:**
```python
notifications_today = 2 ** (days_behind - 1)
# Day 1: 1 notification
# Day 2: 2 notifications
# Day 3: 4 notifications
# Day 4: 8 notifications
```

**Implementation:**
1. Daily check job assesses goal completion
2. If behind, spawns one-shot jobs for later notification slots
3. Notifications spread across the day (harder to ignore)
4. When goal is met, counter resets

**Notification slots:**
```
["09:00", "11:00", "13:00", "15:00", "17:00", "19:00", "21:00", "22:30"]

Day 1 = slot 0 only
Day 2 = slots 0, 4
Day 3 = slots 0, 2, 4, 6
Day 4 = all 8 slots
```

This creates natural consequences for procrastination — configured by you, enforced by the agent.

---

## Best practices

1. **Use timezone** — Always specify `tz` to avoid UTC confusion
2. **Isolated for heavy tasks** — Long-running jobs shouldn't block main session
3. **Deliver directly** — Use `deliver: true` for notifications that need immediate attention
4. **One-shot for reminders** — Use `kind: "at"` for single-fire events
5. **Name your jobs** — Descriptive names make management easier

---

## What's possible

With cron jobs, your agent becomes proactive — not just reactive.

Examples from a real setup:
- 4-stage overnight briefing pipeline (04:00-07:00 UTC)
- 6 daily work check-ins with strategy prompts
- Weekly pattern analysis every Friday
- Automatic backups at 23:00 UTC
- Content goal tracking with escalating nudges

The agent works while you sleep, and delivers results when you wake up.

# Delegating Development to Your Agent

## Why Delegate?

Developer time is limited, so use the agent for routine implementation work.

With Git access, the agent can prepare feature branches, fix scoped bugs, and scaffold components while you are doing other tasks. It can also run checks and open a draft PR with a summary of changes.

You still control the final decision: review the diff, request edits, and merge only what meets your standards.

---

## Two Approaches

### Read-Only (Conservative)

Agent analyzes but doesn't touch code:
- Uses `gh` CLI for read operations
- Reviews PRs, monitors CI, summarizes issues
- Sends insights via Telegram—you act on GitHub

**Best for:** Sensitive repos, building trust.

### Branch-Based Write (Recommended)

Agent pushes code to branches, never to main:
- Has SSH key with push access
- Creates commits, opens PRs
- You review and merge

**Best for:** Personal projects, true autonomy.

---

## Simple Setup (5 minutes)

The following setup is intentionally minimal and works well for a solo repo. As reliability needs increase, move to stronger permission models: use a dedicated bot account, or place repos in a GitHub organization and grant the bot least-privilege access. That gives you cleaner separation, better auditability, and safer scaling when collaborators are added.

**1. Generate SSH key:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "openclaw-bot@yourdomain.com"
```

**2. Add to GitHub:**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy → GitHub → Settings → SSH Keys → New
```

**3. Clone and configure:**
```bash
cd ~/projects/your-repo
git config user.name "OpenClaw Bot"
git config user.email "openclaw-bot@yourdomain.com"
```

**4. Add to SOUL.md:**
```markdown
## Git Workflow
- Always work on branches — never push to main
- Human merges — I create PRs, you decide
```

---

## Protection Layer

Even if the agent misbehaves, GitHub should block it.

**Enable branch protection on main:**
- ☑️ Require pull request before merging
- ☑️ Require approvals
- ☑️ Block force pushes

Your agent can push branches. It cannot touch main.

---

## The Workflow

**You say:** "Add dark mode to settings. Create a PR."

**Agent does:**
1. Creates `feature/dark-mode`
2. Implements changes
3. Commits and pushes
4. Sends you the PR link

**You do:** Review on your phone. Merge when ready.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **SSH keys in `~/.ssh/`** — never in code
- **Branch protection always on** — defense in depth
- **SOUL.md defines constraints** — agent follows your rules
- **Start conservative** — trust compounds

Productivity increases while you're idle.

# Persistent AI agents

## What is a persistent AI agent?

Instead of opening a chat window when you need help, a persistent agent runs 24/7 on a server. You can message it from your phone and get responses anytime.

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) is an open-source framework for this. It lets you:

- Receive messages via Telegram, Signal, or Discord
- Execute commands and manage files on a server
- Run scheduled tasks automatically
- Remember context across conversations

Think of it as:

> "An AI assistant living on a server, available whenever you need it."

---

## Important: Terms of Service

Before setting this up, be aware of potential issues:

- **API usage rules** — Some AI providers may restrict automated or persistent usage of their APIs. There are [reports of Anthropic banning users](https://blogs.cisco.com/ai/personal-ai-agents-like-openclaw-are-a-security-nightmare) running OpenClaw with Claude credentials.

- **Security risks** — Running an AI with shell access on a server is powerful but risky. [Security researchers warn](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/openclaw-ai-runs-wild-business-environments) about supply chain risks from third-party modules.

**Recommendation:** Read the terms of service for your AI provider. Consider running in an isolated sandbox. Don't connect to production systems.

---

## Why run a persistent agent

A persistent agent changes the interaction from "I open a chat" to "I message my assistant."

**Benefits:**
- **Always available** — Message from your phone, get a response
- **Proactive capabilities** — Schedule tasks, run checks, send reminders
- **Shared context** — Memory persists across sessions
- **Integration surface** — One agent connecting calendar, files, APIs

**Good for:**
- AI assistant accessible from anywhere
- Recurring tasks that benefit from automation
- Experimenting with agent capabilities
- Owning your infrastructure

**Not ideal if:**
- You only need occasional interactions
- You don't want to manage a server
- Claude.ai or Claude Code already covers your needs

---

## Requirements

Before starting:

- **Cloud server** — EC2, DigitalOcean, or any Linux VPS (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM minimum)
- **SSH access** — Key-based authentication configured
- **Node.js 18+** — OpenClaw runs on Node
- **API key** — Anthropic, OpenAI, or other provider
- **Messaging account** — Telegram bot token, Signal number, or Discord bot

---

## Setup walkthrough

This documents setup on an AWS EC2 instance with Telegram.

### 1. Install OpenClaw

```bash
# Install Node.js if needed
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install OpenClaw globally
sudo npm install -g openclaw
```

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

The wizard configures:
- API key
- Model selection (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Workspace directory
- Messaging channels

### 3. Configure Telegram

Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather):

1. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
2. Copy the bot token
3. Add to OpenClaw config when prompted

Approve your user with:

```bash
openclaw pairing approve telegram <CODE>
```

### 4. Run as a service

```bash
# Install systemd service
openclaw gateway install

# Start the service
openclaw gateway start

# Check status
openclaw status
```

The agent now runs persistently and survives reboots.

---

## Security hardening

A server running an AI with shell access requires careful security.

### Firewall

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
```

### Fail2ban (SSH protection)

```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban

sudo tee /etc/fail2ban/jail.local << 'EOF'
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600
EOF

sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

After 3 failed SSH attempts in 10 minutes, the IP is banned for 1 hour.

### File permissions

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Config files contain API keys. Restrict access.

### User allowlist

OpenClaw uses pairing mode — unknown users can't interact without approval. Approved users are stored in:

```
~/.openclaw/credentials/telegram-allowFrom.json
```

---

## Memory and context

OpenClaw maintains workspace files that persist:

```
~/.openclaw/workspace/
├── AGENTS.md      # Agent behavior guidelines
├── SOUL.md        # Personality and boundaries
├── USER.md        # Info about you
├── MEMORY.md      # Long-term curated memory
├── TOOLS.md       # Local tool notes
└── memory/
    └── 2026-02-02.md  # Daily logs
```

**What to put in memory:**
- Decisions and their rationale
- Project context and preferences
- Lessons learned
- Recurring tasks

Memory is continuity. Without it, every session starts from zero.

---

## How I use this

1. **Message from phone** — ask the agent to research, draft, or check status
2. **Agent works** — it has server access, can search web, read files, run commands
3. **Response arrives** — results come via Telegram
4. **Agent remembers** — context persists for follow-ups

Works well for:
- Quick research while away from desk
- Drafting content that syncs to cloud storage
- Monitoring server health
- Managing recurring tasks

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Bot not responding | Service stopped | `openclaw gateway start` |
| "Access not configured" | User not approved | `openclaw pairing approve telegram <code>` |
| Commands timeout | Network/firewall | Check `ufw status`, security groups |
| High memory usage | Context too large | Restart gateway |
| Can't SSH | Banned by fail2ban | `sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <IP>` |

# Sub-Agents & Session Isolation

## The short answer

If you change settings (like turning off thinking mode) in your main session, **sub-agents already running are not affected**. They keep working with whatever settings they had when they were spawned.

This is because sub-agents run in **isolated sessions** — separate from your main conversation.

---

## What is a sub-agent?

When your agent needs to do something that takes a while — research, code generation, file analysis — it can **spawn a sub-agent**. This is a separate session that runs in the background while your main conversation continues.

Think of it as:

> "Your agent hiring a contractor to do a specific job, while you keep talking."

You can:
- Keep chatting in your main session
- Spawn multiple sub-agents in parallel
- Get notified when each one finishes

Example: Your agent spawns one sub-agent to analyze a codebase and another to research a topic. Both run simultaneously. You keep messaging about something else entirely.

---

## How sessions work in OpenClaw

OpenClaw runs multiple session types:

| Session type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Main** | Your direct conversation | Telegram chat with your agent |
| **Isolated (sub-agent)** | Background task, spawned by main | "Analyze this repo and create a PR" |
| **Cron** | Triggered by schedule | "Every morning at 8am, compile a briefing" |

Each session is **independent**:
- Separate conversation history
- Separate context window
- Separate settings at spawn time
- Separate token usage tracking

This is the key insight: **sessions don't share state at runtime**.

---

## What happens when you change settings?

Here's a concrete scenario:

1. You're chatting with your agent with **thinking mode ON**
2. Agent spawns two sub-agents (they inherit thinking mode ON)
3. You turn thinking mode **OFF** in your main session
4. The sub-agents **keep running with thinking mode ON**

Why? Because the sub-agents were spawned as independent sessions. Changing your main session settings is like adjusting the thermostat in your office — it doesn't change the temperature in a contractor's office across town.

### Settings that are locked at spawn time

When a sub-agent is created, these are captured at that moment:
- **Model** (e.g., Opus, Sonnet)
- **Thinking mode** (on/off and level)
- **System prompt** and workspace context
- **Tool permissions**

### Settings you can specify per sub-agent

When spawning, your agent can explicitly override:
- `model` — Use a different model than the main session
- `thinking` — Set a specific thinking level

```
sessions_spawn(
  task: "Analyze this codebase",
  model: "sonnet",        // cheaper model for routine work
  thinking: "high"         // but still with deep reasoning
)
```

---

## Why isolation matters

### 1. Reliability
If your main session crashes or gets compacted, sub-agents keep running. They're not dependent on the parent session's state.

### 2. Parallel execution
Multiple sub-agents can run simultaneously because they don't compete for the same context window. Your main session stays responsive.

### 3. Cost control
Sub-agents can use different models. Heavy analysis? Use Opus. Simple file operations? Use Sonnet. Each session tracks its own token usage.

### 4. No cross-contamination
A sub-agent working on a sensitive task doesn't leak context into your main conversation. When it finishes, only the summary is delivered back.

---

## The lifecycle of a sub-agent

```
Main Session                          Sub-Agent Session
─────────────                         ──────────────────
1. User asks for complex task
2. Agent decides to spawn          →  3. New session created
   sub-agent                           (inherits current settings)
4. Agent continues chatting        →  5. Sub-agent works independently
   with user                           (reads files, runs commands,
                                        searches web, etc.)
6. User changes settings
   (e.g., thinking OFF)               7. Sub-agent unaffected
                                        (still using original settings)
8. Agent receives notification  ←  9. Sub-agent completes
   with results summary                (session can be kept or deleted)
10. Agent shares results
    with user
```

---

## Practical implications

### You can keep chatting
Sub-agents don't block your main session. Spawn a 10-minute research task and keep discussing something else.

### Settings changes are safe
Turning off thinking mode, switching models, or changing any configuration in your main session won't interrupt background work. This is by design.

### Sub-agents can't message you directly
They report back to the main session, which then relays the results to you. You won't get a random Telegram message from a sub-agent — your main agent is always the intermediary.

### Token usage is separate
Each sub-agent has its own token counter. When it finishes, you can see exactly how many tokens it used. This matters for quota management.

---

## When to use sub-agents vs. doing it inline

**Use sub-agents when:**
- The task takes more than ~30 seconds
- You want to keep chatting while it works
- You need parallel execution (multiple tasks at once)
- The task benefits from a fresh context window (no conversation clutter)
- You want to use a different model for the task

**Do it inline when:**
- Quick operations (reading a file, simple search)
- You need the result immediately to continue the conversation
- The task requires back-and-forth with you

---

## Cron jobs: another form of isolation

Cron jobs that use `sessionTarget: "isolated"` work the same way. When a cron job fires, it creates a fresh isolated session with whatever model and settings are specified in the job configuration — not whatever your main session is currently using.

This means:
- Your overnight briefing job keeps running even if you changed your main session to Sonnet
- A cron job set to use `thinking: "high"` will always use it, regardless of your current toggle
- Each cron run is independent of previous runs (fresh context)

---

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Do sub-agents share my main session? | No — fully isolated |
| If I change settings, are sub-agents affected? | No — they use settings from spawn time |
| Can I spawn multiple sub-agents? | Yes — they run in parallel |
| Do sub-agents use my token quota? | Yes — but tracked separately per session |
| Can I specify different models per sub-agent? | Yes — via `model` parameter |
| Do cron jobs work the same way? | Yes — isolated cron jobs are independent sessions |

The core principle: **sessions are isolated by design**. This gives you reliability, parallelism, and the freedom to change settings without worrying about breaking background work.

# Telegram Groups & Topics: Organizing AI Conversations

## The problem: one chat, too many conversations

When everything goes through a single DM — news updates, work coaching, system reports, overnight briefings, daily check-ins — the signal-to-noise ratio drops fast. You scroll past security reports looking for that news digest from this morning. You lose a strategic insight buried between cron job outputs.

Telegram **forum topics** fix this. Available in supergroups, they create named threads within a single group. Combined with OpenClaw, you get:

- **Separate conversation histories** — each topic gets its own session
- **Organized cron delivery** — overnight briefings go to one topic, security reports to another
- **Custom behavior per topic** — different system prompts, different tool access
- **Clean mental model** — glance at topic names, find what you need

Think of it as:

> "Slack channels, but for your personal AI agent."

---

## How OpenClaw handles topics

Before diving into setup, it helps to understand the architecture:

- Each topic gets a **unique session key**: `agent:main:telegram:group:<chatId>:topic:<threadId>`
- Topics **inherit** their parent group's config unless overridden
- The **General** topic (thread ID `1`) is special — Telegram's API requires different handling for it
- Each topic session is **isolated** — conversation history doesn't leak between topics

This means the bot in your "News" topic doesn't know what you discussed in "Work Coaching." That's by design. Shared context lives in workspace files (MEMORY.md, daily notes) that the bot reads regardless of which topic it's in.

---

## Step 1: Create the supergroup

In Telegram (mobile or desktop):

1. **Create a new group** — give it a name (e.g., "🧠 OpenClaw Hub")
2. **Enable topics**: Group Settings → Topics → Enable
3. **Create your topics** — tap "Create Topic" for each one

Suggested structure:

| Topic | Emoji | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| General | 💬 | Daily chat, quick questions |
| News & Research | 📰 | AI/tech/blockchain digests |
| Work Coaching | 💼 | Career strategy, work dynamics |
| Content & Publishing | ✍️ | Blog posts, PRs, content pipeline |
| Security & System | 🔒 | Healthchecks, security reports |
| Overnight Briefings | 🌙 | Morning prep, overnight analysis |

You can always add or rename topics later.

---

## Step 2: Configure your bot

Your bot needs to see all group messages. Two options:

**Option A: Disable privacy mode** (in BotFather)
1. Message `@BotFather` → `/setprivacy` → select your bot → **Disable**
2. After changing this, **remove and re-add** the bot to the group (required for the change to take effect)

**Option B: Make the bot a group admin** (recommended)
Admin bots bypass privacy mode entirely. When you add the bot to the group, promote it to admin with:
- ✅ Send Messages
- ✅ Manage Topics (optional — lets the bot create/manage topics)
- ✅ Pin Messages (optional — useful for summaries)

---

## Step 3: Add the bot and get IDs

1. Open your supergroup → **Add Member** → search for your bot
2. Promote to admin (recommended)
3. Send a test message in any topic

Now you need two pieces of information:

### Group chat ID

The numeric chat ID (negative number like `-1001234567890`). Find it from gateway logs:

```bash
openclaw logs --follow
# Send a message in the group, look for chat.id in the log output
```

Or via the Bot API:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates" \
  | jq '.result[-1].message.chat.id'
```

### Topic thread IDs

Each topic has a numeric `message_thread_id`. Send a message in each topic and check the gateway logs — look for `message_thread_id` in the inbound message.

Note down every thread ID. You'll need them for per-topic config and cron delivery.

---

## Step 4: Configure OpenClaw

### Minimal config

This gets the bot responding in all topics:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "groupAllowFrom": ["YOUR_USER_ID"],
      "groups": {
        "-1001234567890": {
          "requireMention": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Setting `requireMention: false` means you don't need to @mention the bot — useful in a private group where you're the only human.

### Full config with per-topic customization

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "groupAllowFrom": ["YOUR_USER_ID"],
      "groups": {
        "-1001234567890": {
          "requireMention": false,
          "systemPrompt": "You are in the OpenClaw Hub. Be concise.",
          "topics": {
            "1": {
              "systemPrompt": "General chat. Be conversational."
            },
            "42": {
              "systemPrompt": "Focus on AI, blockchain, and tech news. Include source links and consequence analysis.",
              "tools": { "deny": ["exec"] }
            },
            "43": {
              "systemPrompt": "Act as a strategic work coach. Reference the career transition plan. Be direct."
            },
            "45": {
              "systemPrompt": "System administration and security. Report with severity levels."
            },
            "46": {
              "systemPrompt": "Deliver overnight analysis. Key findings first, then details."
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Apply the config:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Or use the gateway config tool to patch your existing config without replacing it entirely.

## Routing cron jobs to topics

This is where topics become powerful. Each cron job can deliver its output to a specific topic using the delivery target format:

```
-1001234567890:topic:<threadId>
```

### Example: Security report → Security topic

```json
{
  "name": "Daily Security Check",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 14 * * *",
    "tz": "UTC"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run a security healthcheck. Check SSH logins, disk usage, pending updates."
  },
  "delivery": {
    "mode": "announce",
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "-1001234567890:topic:45"
  }
}
```

### Example: Morning briefing → Overnight topic

```json
{
  "name": "Morning Briefing Delivery",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 11 * * *",
    "tz": "UTC"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Read the latest overnight briefing and deliver a concise summary.",
    "model": "sonnet"
  },
  "delivery": {
    "mode": "announce",
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "-1001234567890:topic:46"
  }
}
```

### Delivery rules to remember

- `delivery.mode = "announce"` → cron output goes directly to the specified topic
- `delivery.mode = "none"` → no message posted (for background work)
- If `delivery` is omitted for isolated jobs, OpenClaw defaults to `announce` in the last-used channel
- The `delivery.channel` and `delivery.to` fields handle routing — don't use the messaging tool inside the cron run

---

## Per-topic configuration options

Each topic under `topics.<threadId>` supports:

| Setting | What it does | Inherits from group? |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| `systemPrompt` | Extra instructions for this topic | Yes |
| `requireMention` | Whether @mention is needed | Yes |
| `allowFrom` | Who can trigger the bot here | Yes |
| `tools` | Tool allow/deny lists | Yes |
| `enabled` | Disable the topic entirely | Yes |

### Restricting tools per topic

```json
{
  "topics": {
    "42": {
      "tools": { "deny": ["exec", "write", "edit"] }
    }
  }
}
```

This makes the News topic read-only — the bot can search the web and analyze, but can't execute commands or modify files.

### Disabling a topic

```json
{
  "topics": {
    "99": { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

The bot silently ignores messages in disabled topics.

---

## Privacy and security

### Keep it personal

Telegram doesn't support per-topic member restrictions. **Everyone in the group sees all topics.** For a personal AI hub, keep the group private with only you and the bot.

### Session isolation

Each topic has its own session — conversation history doesn't cross between topics. But workspace files (MEMORY.md, daily notes, guides) are shared across all sessions because they belong to the same agent.

### Access control

```json
{
  "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
  "groupAllowFrom": ["YOUR_USER_ID"]
}
```

Even in groups with `groupPolicy: "open"`, control commands (`/status`, `/reset`) still require authorization.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond in topics:**
1. Check privacy mode — must be Disabled in BotFather, OR bot must be admin
2. After changing privacy mode, remove and re-add the bot
3. Check `openclaw logs --follow` for "skipping group message" errors
4. Verify the group ID is in your config

**Bot responds in some topics but not others:**
1. Check if the topic has `enabled: false`
2. Check per-topic `requireMention` settings

**Cron delivers to DM instead of group topic:**
1. Verify `delivery.to` format: `-1001234567890:topic:<threadId>`
2. Verify `delivery.channel` is `"telegram"`
3. Check the thread ID is correct (from logs)

**Messages appear in General instead of the target topic:**
This usually means `message_thread_id` is missing. Verify you're using the `:topic:` format in delivery targets.

---

## Limitations

**No per-topic member restrictions** — Telegram limitation. Use a private group as workaround.

**No draft streaming in groups** — Replies appear as complete messages, not streamed word-by-word. This is a Telegram API limitation.

**Session context doesn't cross topics** — By design. Use workspace files for shared context.

**Rate limits apply per bot** — Many simultaneous cron deliveries could hit limits. Stagger schedules by a few minutes. OpenClaw retries automatically with exponential backoff.

---

## Summary

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Create topics | Telegram → Group Settings → Enable Topics |
| Bot access | Admin role OR privacy mode disabled |
| Config location | `channels.telegram.groups.<chatId>.topics` |
| Per-topic prompts | `topics.<threadId>.systemPrompt` |
| Cron delivery | `delivery.to: "-100xxx:topic:<threadId>"` |
| Session key format | `agent:main:telegram:group:<chatId>:topic:<threadId>` |

The setup takes about 15 minutes. The payoff — organized conversations, targeted cron delivery, topic-specific behavior — compounds every day you use it.

# Voice notes with Telegram

## The problem

Voice input is faster than typing, especially on mobile. You want to send a voice note to your OpenClaw agent and have it understand what you said.

OpenClaw has built-in audio transcription support via Deepgram, but there's a catch: **it doesn't work automatically with Telegram voice notes** (as of v2026.1.30). The voice files get saved, but the transcription pipeline doesn't trigger. The agent receives an empty message.

This appears to be a Telegram-specific issue. The built-in transcription may only work for WhatsApp, based on documentation references to "WhatsApp Web channel behavior."

Until this is fixed upstream, here's a workaround that works reliably.

---

## The solution

We build a manual transcription system:

1. **Voice files are saved** — OpenClaw already saves incoming audio to `~/.openclaw/media/inbound/`
2. **Trigger word activates transcription** — Send "audio" after your voice note
3. **Script transcribes via Deepgram API** — Converts speech to text with retry logic
4. **Agent receives and executes** — Treats the transcription as an instruction

The flow becomes:

```
[Voice note] → [Type "audio"] → [Agent transcribes] → [Agent executes instruction]
```

Not as seamless as automatic transcription, but reliable and fast.

---

## Why this approach

**Why not wait for a fix?**

The upstream issue might take time. This workaround lets you use voice input today.

**Why Deepgram?**

- Deepgram's `whisper-large` model handles Telegram's Opus audio format well
- Free tier gives $200 credit (~770 hours of audio)
- Simple API, no complex setup

**Why a trigger word?**

Without automatic transcription, the agent doesn't know a voice note arrived. The trigger word ("audio") signals: "transcribe the latest file and treat it as my instruction."

---

## Requirements

Before starting:

- **OpenClaw running on a server** — with Telegram configured
- **Deepgram account** — free tier at [deepgram.com](https://deepgram.com)
- **ffmpeg installed** — for audio conversion
- **curl and jq** — for API calls and JSON parsing

---

## Setup walkthrough

### 1. Get a Deepgram API key

1. Sign up at [console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com)
2. Create a new API key with "Usage" permissions
3. Copy the key — you'll need it in the next step

### 2. Add the API key to your environment

Add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Important:** If OpenClaw runs as a systemd service, environment variables from `.bashrc` aren't available. Add the key to the service file:

```bash
# Edit the service file
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service

# Add under [Service]:
Environment=DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Reload and restart
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg jq curl
```

### 4. Create the transcription script

Create `~/.openclaw/scripts/transcribe-deepgram`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

FILE="$1"
LANG="${2:-en}"

if [[ -z "$DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" ]]; then
  echo "Error: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY not set" >&2
  exit 1
fi

if [[ ! -f "$FILE" ]]; then
  echo "Error: File not found: $FILE" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Convert to WAV for better compatibility
TMP_WAV=$(mktemp --suffix=.wav)
trap "rm -f $TMP_WAV" EXIT

ffmpeg -y -i "$FILE" -ar 16000 -ac 1 "$TMP_WAV" 2>/dev/null

# Call Deepgram API
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper-large&language=${LANG}" \
  -H "Authorization: Token $DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: audio/wav" \
  --data-binary "@$TMP_WAV")

# Extract transcript
TRANSCRIPT=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript // empty')

if [[ -z "$TRANSCRIPT" ]]; then
  echo "Error: No transcript returned" >&2
  echo "Response: $RESPONSE" >&2
  exit 1
fi

echo "$TRANSCRIPT"
```

Make executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/scripts/transcribe-deepgram
```

### 5. Create the robust wrapper script

This script adds retry logic and auto-cleanup. Create `~/.openclaw/scripts/transcribe-robust`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -uo pipefail

INBOUND_DIR="$HOME/.openclaw/media/inbound"
SCRIPT_DIR="$HOME/.openclaw/scripts"

# Handle "latest" keyword
if [[ "${1:-}" == "latest" ]]; then
  FILE=$(ls -t "$INBOUND_DIR"/file_*---*.ogg 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  if [[ -z "$FILE" ]]; then
    echo "# No audio files found in $INBOUND_DIR"
    exit 1
  fi
  echo "# Found latest file: $FILE"
else
  FILE="$1"
fi

LANG="${2:-en}"
MAX_ATTEMPTS="${3:-3}"
DELAY="${4:-2}"

echo "# Attempting transcription of: $FILE"
echo "# Max attempts: $MAX_ATTEMPTS, Delay: ${DELAY}s"

for ((i=1; i<=MAX_ATTEMPTS; i++)); do
  echo "# Attempt $i/$MAX_ATTEMPTS..."

  # Wait for file to stabilize (still downloading?)
  PREV_SIZE=0
  CURR_SIZE=$(stat -c%s "$FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  while [[ "$CURR_SIZE" != "$PREV_SIZE" ]]; do
    sleep 0.5
    PREV_SIZE=$CURR_SIZE
    CURR_SIZE=$(stat -c%s "$FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  done
  echo "# File stable at $CURR_SIZE bytes, transcribing..."

  # Attempt transcription
  RESULT=$("$SCRIPT_DIR/transcribe-deepgram" "$FILE" "$LANG" 2>&1)
  EXIT_CODE=$?

  if [[ $EXIT_CODE -eq 0 && -n "$RESULT" && "$RESULT" != "Error:"* ]]; then
    echo "# Success on attempt $i"
    echo "$RESULT"

    # Auto-delete the processed file
    rm -f "$FILE"
    echo "# Deleted: $FILE" >&2
    exit 0
  fi

  echo "# Attempt $i failed: $RESULT" >&2

  if [[ $i -lt $MAX_ATTEMPTS ]]; then
    echo "# Waiting ${DELAY}s before retry..."
    sleep "$DELAY"
  fi
done

echo "# All $MAX_ATTEMPTS attempts failed"
exit 1
```

Make executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/scripts/transcribe-robust
```

### 6. Configure your agent to use the trigger word

Add to your agent's workspace files (e.g., `TOOLS.md` or `MEMORY.md`):

```markdown
### Voice Transcription

**Trigger word: "audio"** — When you send just "audio", immediately transcribe the latest voice note.

**Process:**
1. Run `~/.openclaw/scripts/transcribe-robust latest`
2. Reply with the transcription
3. Execute the transcribed instruction

**Why:** OpenClaw's built-in Telegram audio transcription doesn't trigger automatically. This manual trigger is the workaround.
```

The agent will learn to respond to "audio" by running the transcription script.

---

## Usage

1. **Send a voice note** via Telegram to your bot
2. **Type "audio"** as a follow-up message
3. **Agent transcribes** and shows you what it heard
4. **Agent executes** the instruction from the voice note

Example exchange:

```
You: [voice note: "Check the disk usage on the server"]
You: audio

Agent: **Transcription:**
> "Check the disk usage on the server"

[runs df -h and shows results]
```

---

## How I use this

Voice notes are my primary input method. Typing on mobile is slow. Speaking is fast.

My workflow:

- **Walking or commuting** — send voice instructions
- **Quick tasks** — "check my calendar", "what's the weather"
- **Complex requests** — explain context verbally, faster than typing

The extra "audio" message is a small friction, but acceptable until automatic transcription works.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY not set" | Env var missing | Add to `.bashrc` and service file |
| "No audio files found" | Files cleaned up or wrong path | Check `~/.openclaw/media/inbound/` |
| Empty transcript | Wrong model for codec | Use `whisper-large`, not `nova-2` |
| Permission denied | Script not executable | Run `chmod +x` on both scripts |
| File still downloading | Transcription too fast | Script has stability check, should handle this |

### Verifying files are saved

Check that Telegram voice notes arrive:

```bash
ls -la ~/.openclaw/media/inbound/
```

You should see files like `file_14---83e1fcde-69a1-4773-9cb0-f771f7bdb8b7.ogg`.

### Testing transcription manually

```bash
~/.openclaw/scripts/transcribe-robust latest
```

Should output the transcribed text if a voice file exists.

---

## Cost

Deepgram pricing after free tier:

- **Pay-as-you-go:** ~$0.0043/minute
- **Free tier:** $200 credit (~770 hours)

For typical personal use, the free tier lasts a long time.

---

## Why not use OpenClaw's built-in transcription?

OpenClaw does have audio transcription config:

```json
"tools.media.audio": {
  "enabled": true,
  "language": "en",
  "models": [{"provider": "deepgram", "model": "whisper-large"}]
}
```

This config is correct, and I have it enabled. The issue is that **Telegram voice notes don't trigger the transcription pipeline**. The files save, but the agent receives no transcript.

I've reported this to the OpenClaw community. It may be fixed in a future release, or it may be a Telegram-specific limitation. This workaround bridges the gap.

---

## Future improvements

If automatic transcription gets fixed upstream:

- Remove the trigger word requirement
- Agent would receive `{{Transcript}}` automatically in the message
- These scripts become backup/fallback only

Until then, "voice note + audio" is a reliable pattern.
