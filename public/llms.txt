# Turtleand OpenClaw Lab

> Practical setup guides for the OpenClaw AI assistant platform. From installation to advanced automation.

## Guides
- [I Asked an AI to Design My Banner. Then I Built It Myself.](https://openclaw.turtleand.com/topics/banner-generation-ai-vs-code): A real comparison: AI image generation vs. code-generated graphics for a Twitter/X profile banner. Same brief, two approaches, very different results.
- [Claude CLI Integration](https://openclaw.turtleand.com/topics/claude-cli-integration): Run Claude CLI commands through OpenClaw and monitor your Anthropic usage limits.
- [Cron Jobs & Scheduled Automation](https://openclaw.turtleand.com/topics/cron-jobs-automation): Schedule recurring tasks, reminders, and automated check-ins with OpenClaw's built-in cron system.
- [Delegating Development to Your Agent](https://openclaw.turtleand.com/topics/git-autonomous-development): Configure Git access so OpenClaw can develop on your behalf while you're away.
- [Persistent AI agents](https://openclaw.turtleand.com/topics/persistent-agents): Deploy an always-on AI agent on a cloud server with messaging and security.
- [Sub-Agents & Session Isolation](https://openclaw.turtleand.com/topics/sub-agents-and-session-isolation): How sub-agents work, why they're isolated from your main session, and what happens when you change settings mid-flight.
- [Telegram Groups & Topics: Organizing AI Conversations](https://openclaw.turtleand.com/topics/telegram-groups-topics): Use Telegram supergroups with forum topics to organize your AI agent's conversations — news in one thread, work coaching in another, system reports in a third.
- [Voice notes with Telegram](https://openclaw.turtleand.com/topics/voice-notes-telegram): Send voice messages to your AI agent and have them transcribed and executed.
