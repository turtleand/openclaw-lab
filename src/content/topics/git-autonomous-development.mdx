## Why Delegate?

You have limited hours. Your agent doesn't.

While you sleep, commute, or live your life, an AI with Git access can draft features, fix bugs, and scaffold components. The code waits for your review—the work happens without you.

> Delegation isn't laziness. It's leverage.

## Two Approaches

### Read-Only (Conservative)

Agent analyzes but doesn't touch code:
- Uses `gh` CLI for read operations
- Reviews PRs, monitors CI, summarizes issues
- Sends insights via Telegram—you act on GitHub

**Best for:** Sensitive repos, building trust.

### Branch-Based Write (Recommended)

Agent pushes code to branches, never to main:
- Has SSH key with push access
- Creates commits, opens PRs
- You review and merge

**Best for:** Personal projects, true autonomy.

---

## Setup (5 minutes)

**1. Generate SSH key:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "openclaw-bot@yourdomain.com"
```

**2. Add to GitHub:**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy → GitHub → Settings → SSH Keys → New
```

**3. Clone and configure:**
```bash
cd ~/projects/your-repo
git config user.name "OpenClaw Bot"
git config user.email "openclaw-bot@yourdomain.com"
```

**4. Add to SOUL.md:**
```markdown
## Git Workflow
- Always work on branches — never push to main
- Human merges — I create PRs, you decide
```

---

## Protection Layer

Even if the agent misbehaves, GitHub should block it.

**Enable branch protection on main:**
- ☑️ Require pull request before merging
- ☑️ Require approvals
- ☑️ Block force pushes

Your agent can push branches. It cannot touch main.

---

## The Workflow

**You say:** "Add dark mode to settings. Create a PR."

**Agent does:**
1. Creates `feature/dark-mode`
2. Implements changes
3. Commits and pushes
4. Sends you the PR link

**You do:** Review on your phone. Merge when ready.

## Trust Gradient

Start small. Expand as confidence grows.

| Phase | Access | Your Role |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Week 1-2 | Read-only | You take all actions |
| Week 3-4 | Branch write | Heavy review |
| Month 2+ | Full delegation | Architecture + review |

---

## Key Takeaways

- **SSH keys in `~/.ssh/`** — never in code
- **Branch protection always on** — defense in depth
- **SOUL.md defines constraints** — agent follows your rules
- **Start conservative** — trust compounds

> Senior = LEVERAGE not LABOR.

The code gets written while you sleep. The vision remains yours.
