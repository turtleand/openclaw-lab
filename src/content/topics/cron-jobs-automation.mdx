## What are cron jobs in OpenClaw?

OpenClaw includes a built-in cron scheduler that lets your agent run tasks automatically — without you sending a message.

Use cases:
- **Morning briefings** — Agent compiles overnight insights and delivers them when you wake up
- **Accountability nudges** — Reminders that escalate if you don't complete a goal
- **Daily backups** — Automatic state sync to cloud storage
- **Work check-ins** — Structured prompts at key moments in your day
- **Security audits** — Daily reports on system health

Think of it as:

> "Your agent doing things on a schedule, not just when you ask."

## How cron jobs work

Cron jobs in OpenClaw are managed internally by the Gateway — not as files on disk.

**Key concepts:**
- Jobs are created/modified via tool calls (`cron action=add/update/remove`)
- Each job has a schedule (cron expression or one-time timestamp)
- Jobs can target the main session or spawn isolated sessions
- Jobs can deliver messages directly to Telegram/Discord/etc.

---

## Schedule types

### Recurring (cron expression)

```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 9 * * 1-5",
    "tz": "America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires"
  }
}
```

This runs at 09:00 Monday-Friday in the specified timezone.

**Cron expression format:** `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`

Common patterns:
- `0 9 * * *` — Daily at 09:00
- `0 9 * * 1-5` — Weekdays at 09:00
- `0 */2 * * *` — Every 2 hours
- `30 18 * * 5` — Fridays at 18:30

### One-time (at timestamp)

```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "at",
    "atMs": 1770703200000
  }
}
```

Runs once at the specified Unix timestamp (milliseconds). Useful for reminders.

---

## Payload types

### systemEvent (main session)

Injects a message into the main session as if it were a system event:

```json
{
  "sessionTarget": "main",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "REMINDER: Check your GitHub commits for today."
  }
}
```

The agent wakes up, sees the message, and responds in context.

### agentTurn (isolated session)

Spawns a fresh session with its own context:

```json
{
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run the morning briefing compilation task.",
    "model": "sonnet",
    "deliver": true,
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "123456789"
  }
}
```

Good for:
- Long-running tasks that shouldn't clutter main session
- Different model/thinking settings
- Direct delivery to a channel

---

## Real examples

### Morning briefing delivery

```json
{
  "name": "Morning Briefing Delivery",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 11 * * *",
    "tz": "UTC"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Read the latest overnight briefing file and deliver it to Turtleand.",
    "model": "sonnet",
    "deliver": true,
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "5586308961"
  }
}
```

### Accountability check with escalation

```json
{
  "name": "content-goal-daily-check",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 9 * * 1-5",
    "tz": "America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "main",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "CONTENT GOAL CHECK: Read memory/CONTENT-STATS.md. If weekly goals not met, calculate days behind and send reminders. Formula: 2^(daysBehind-1) notifications spread throughout the day."
  }
}
```

### One-time reminder

```json
{
  "name": "x-followup-reminder",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "at",
    "atMs": 1770703200000
  },
  "sessionTarget": "main",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "REMINDER: Follow up on your X post with the blog link."
  }
}
```

### Daily backup

```json
{
  "name": "daily-backup",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "0 23 * * *",
    "tz": "UTC"
  },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run ~/.openclaw/scripts/backup-state auto and report results.",
    "deliver": true,
    "to": "5586308961"
  }
}
```

---

## Managing cron jobs

### List all jobs

Ask your agent: "List all cron jobs" or use the cron tool directly.

### Add a job

```
cron action=add job={
  "name": "my-reminder",
  "schedule": {"kind": "cron", "expr": "0 9 * * *", "tz": "UTC"},
  "payload": {"kind": "systemEvent", "text": "Good morning!"},
  "sessionTarget": "main",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Remove a job

```
cron action=remove jobId=<uuid>
```

### Update a job

```
cron action=update jobId=<uuid> patch={"enabled": false}
```

### Run manually

```
cron action=run jobId=<uuid>
```

## Escalating accountability pattern

A powerful pattern: reminders that increase in frequency the longer you avoid a goal.

**Logic:**
```python
notifications_today = 2 ** (days_behind - 1)
# Day 1: 1 notification
# Day 2: 2 notifications
# Day 3: 4 notifications
# Day 4: 8 notifications
```

**Implementation:**
1. Daily check job assesses goal completion
2. If behind, spawns one-shot jobs for later notification slots
3. Notifications spread across the day (harder to ignore)
4. When goal is met, counter resets

**Notification slots:**
```
["09:00", "11:00", "13:00", "15:00", "17:00", "19:00", "21:00", "22:30"]

Day 1 = slot 0 only
Day 2 = slots 0, 4
Day 3 = slots 0, 2, 4, 6
Day 4 = all 8 slots
```

This creates natural consequences for procrastination — configured by you, enforced by the agent.

---

## Best practices

1. **Use timezone** — Always specify `tz` to avoid UTC confusion
2. **Isolated for heavy tasks** — Long-running jobs shouldn't block main session
3. **Deliver directly** — Use `deliver: true` for notifications that need immediate attention
4. **One-shot for reminders** — Use `kind: "at"` for single-fire events
5. **Name your jobs** — Descriptive names make management easier

---

## What's possible

With cron jobs, your agent becomes proactive — not just reactive.

Examples from a real setup:
- 4-stage overnight briefing pipeline (04:00-07:00 UTC)
- 6 daily work check-ins with strategy prompts
- Weekly pattern analysis every Friday
- Automatic backups at 23:00 UTC
- Content goal tracking with escalating nudges

The agent works while you sleep, and delivers results when you wake up.
