## What is a persistent OpenClaw agent?

Instead of you opening ChatGPT and prompting a model manually, a persistent [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) agent runs 24/7 on a server. You message it, and OpenClaw does the work: writing articles, generating images, running code, managing files.

The difference from a traditional AI model is ownership. OpenClaw is an open-source framework that gives you:

- Receive messages via Telegram, Signal, or Discord
- Execute commands and manage files on a server
- Run scheduled tasks automatically
- Remember context across conversations

Think of it as:

> "An agent that works for you. Not a model you prompt, but a partner that generates, builds, and ships."

## Important: Terms of Service

Before setting this up, be aware of potential issues:

- **API usage rules** — Some AI providers may restrict automated or persistent usage of their APIs. There are [reports of Anthropic banning users](https://blogs.cisco.com/ai/personal-ai-agents-like-openclaw-are-a-security-nightmare) running OpenClaw with Claude credentials.

- **Security risks** — Running an AI with shell access on a server is powerful but risky. [Security researchers warn](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/openclaw-ai-runs-wild-business-environments) about supply chain risks from third-party modules.

**Recommendation:** Read the terms of service for your AI provider. Consider running in an isolated sandbox. Don't connect to production systems.

## Why run a persistent OpenClaw agent

A persistent OpenClaw agent changes the interaction from "I open a chat" to "I message my agent."

**Benefits:**
- **Always available** — Message from your phone, get a response from OpenClaw
- **Proactive capabilities** — Cron jobs, heartbeat checks, scheduled reminders
- **Shared context** — OpenClaw's memory system persists across sessions
- **Integration surface** — One agent connecting calendar, files, APIs, messaging channels

**Good for:**
- An OpenClaw agent accessible from anywhere via Telegram, Signal, or Discord
- Recurring tasks that benefit from automation
- Experimenting with agent capabilities on your own infrastructure
- Full ownership of your AI setup — no vendor lock-in

**Not ideal if:**
- You only need occasional interactions
- You don't want to manage a server
- Claude.ai or Claude Code already covers your needs

## Requirements

Before starting:

- **Cloud server** — EC2, DigitalOcean, or any Linux VPS (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM minimum)
- **SSH access** — Key-based authentication configured
- **Node.js 18+** — OpenClaw runs on Node
- **API key** — Anthropic, OpenAI, or other provider
- **Messaging account** — Telegram bot token, Signal number, or Discord bot

## Setup walkthrough

This documents setup on an AWS EC2 instance with Telegram.

### 1. Install OpenClaw

```bash
# Install Node.js if needed
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install OpenClaw globally
sudo npm install -g openclaw
```

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

The wizard configures:
- API key
- Model selection (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Workspace directory
- Messaging channels

### 3. Configure Telegram

Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather):

1. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
2. Copy the bot token
3. Add to OpenClaw config when prompted

Approve your user with:

```bash
openclaw pairing approve telegram <CODE>
```

### 4. Run as a service

```bash
# Install systemd service
openclaw gateway install

# Start the service
openclaw gateway start

# Check status
openclaw status
```

The agent now runs persistently and survives reboots.

## Security hardening

A server running OpenClaw with shell access requires careful security.

### Firewall

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
```

### Fail2ban (SSH protection)

```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban

sudo tee /etc/fail2ban/jail.local << 'EOF'
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600
EOF

sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

After 3 failed SSH attempts in 10 minutes, the IP is banned for 1 hour.

### File permissions

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Config files contain API keys. Restrict access.

### User allowlist

OpenClaw uses pairing mode — unknown users can't interact without approval. Approved users are stored in:

```
~/.openclaw/credentials/telegram-allowFrom.json
```

## OpenClaw memory and context

OpenClaw maintains workspace files that persist across sessions and restarts:

```
~/.openclaw/workspace/
├── AGENTS.md      # Agent behavior guidelines
├── SOUL.md        # Personality and boundaries
├── USER.md        # Info about you
├── MEMORY.md      # Long-term curated memory
├── TOOLS.md       # Local tool notes
└── memory/
    └── 2026-02-02.md  # Daily logs
```

**What to put in memory:**
- Decisions and their rationale
- Project context and preferences
- Lessons learned
- Recurring tasks

Memory is continuity. Without it, every session starts from zero.

## How OpenClaw works for me

The key shift: OpenClaw generates the output, not me. I give direction. OpenClaw writes, builds, and ships.

1. **I message from my phone** — "write an article about persistent agents" or "generate an image for the blog"
2. **OpenClaw executes** — it writes the draft, generates the image, commits code, creates pull requests. All autonomously.
3. **Results arrive** — finished work delivered back via Telegram
4. **OpenClaw remembers** — context persists across sessions. Tomorrow it picks up where it left off.

This article, for example, was written by OpenClaw. Not by me opening a chat window and prompting a model. The agent did the research, structured the content, and published it.

Works well for:
- Content generation (articles, images, documentation)
- Code changes with git workflow (branches, PRs, deploys)
- Research and synthesis while you're away from the desk
- Scheduled autonomous tasks (daily reports, monitoring, backups)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Bot not responding | Service stopped | `openclaw gateway start` |
| "Access not configured" | User not approved | `openclaw pairing approve telegram <code>` |
| Commands timeout | Network/firewall | Check `ufw status`, security groups |
| High memory usage | Context too large | Restart gateway |
| Can't SSH | Banned by fail2ban | `sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <IP>` |
